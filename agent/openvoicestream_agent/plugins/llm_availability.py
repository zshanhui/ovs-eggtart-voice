"""LLMAvailability — health probe + circuit breaker as a single state machine.

Combines the responsibilities of a health probe and a circuit breaker into
one component to avoid split-brain (health says green / breaker says OPEN).

State machine:
    HEALTHY ──probe fail──► DEGRADED ──N consecutive fails──► DOWN
       ▲                       │                                │
       │                       └────probe pass──┐               │
       │                                        ▼               │
       └────────────────────────────────── RECOVERING ◄─probe pass
                                                │
                                                └─probe fail──► DOWN

Probes hit `/v1/chat/completions` with `max_tokens=1` — NOT `/v1/models`,
which only returns metadata and would return green even when generation
is broken (api_server.py:86-96).

Probe timeouts return ``None`` (unknown) so a slow LLM doesn't get
mis-classified as DOWN by probe cadence alone.

External failures (a real user request that raised) feed back through
``report_request_failure()`` so the state advances within seconds rather
than waiting for the next probe interval.
