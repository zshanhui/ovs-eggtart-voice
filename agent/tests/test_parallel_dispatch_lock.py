"""Plan D item 5 — parallel-mode dispatch latency monitoring.

Contract being tested (registry.py + runner.py):
  * Tools declared with ``response_mode="parallel"`` MUST return their
    ``{"started": True}`` stub within ~200ms (hard ceiling ~500ms).
  * The runner logs a WARNING when a parallel-mode tool's dispatch
    exceeds ``_PARALLEL_DISPATCH_BUDGET_MS`` (currently 500ms). This is
    the monitoring hook that flags "you wrote a 'parallel' tool that
    actually blocks" — without it, parallel-mode design degrades
    silently to await-mode latency.

Scenario: two parallel-mode tools share an ``asyncio.Lock`` (e.g. a
single serial port to the arm). Tool A dispatches fast (acquires the
lock + kicks off a worker). Tool B's dispatch then blocks on the lock.
The runner serialises dispatches in a loop, so B's wait shows up as
``dt_ms`` and (once long enough) triggers the >500ms WARNING.
