"""Regression: mic_pump must NOT block indefinitely on slv.send_audio
when SLV is mid-reconnect.

Before the fix, an SLV WS close (keepalive ping timeout) followed by a
slow ws_connect (network blip / opening-handshake timeout) would have
every mic chunk park on SLVClient._send_lock for the full reconnect
window. mic_pump stops draining its input queue, sounddevice's callback
thread floods call_soon_threadsafe with PCM, and the log fills with
``mic queue full -- dropping chunk`` for the entire outage — the user
sees "agent feels dead, mic doesn't work" until reconnect finally lands.

The fix: cap send_audio with a 0.5 s timeout per chunk and drop on
TimeoutError so mic_pump keeps draining.
