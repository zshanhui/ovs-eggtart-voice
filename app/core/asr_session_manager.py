"""Per-utterance ASR session manager.

Owns the lifecycle of streaming ASR sessions for a single WebSocket connection:
fresh ``ASRStream`` per utterance, generation tokens guarding against stale
finals, bounded cancellation with worker-restart fallback, and ERROR_REBUILD
recovery on worker protocol errors.
