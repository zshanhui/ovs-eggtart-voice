"""Concurrency capability descriptor for ASR/TTS backends.

Describes runtime concurrency properties (separate from feature capabilities
such as ``STREAMING``) so the session limiter and coordinator can derive
ceilings from backend reality instead of profile-only defaults.

See ``docs/specs/concurrency-capability-framework.md`` (Section 1) for the
full field semantics. This module is P0 scope — pure framework, zero
behavior change. The limiter does not yet read from these descriptors;
P1 will wire them up.
