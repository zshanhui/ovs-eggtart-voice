"""Auto-download Qwen3 ASR/TTS engine artifacts from HuggingFace.

When a Jetson backend's ``preload()`` detects missing engine / config /
tokenizer files, this module fetches them via ``snapshot_download`` from
the repo declared in
``/opt/qwen3-edgellm-jetson/deploy/artifacts/qwen3_manifest.json``.

Behavior
--------
* Gated by ``OVS_AUTO_DOWNLOAD_ARTIFACTS`` env (default ``"1"`` = on).
  Set to ``"0"`` for air-gapped deployments where artifacts MUST be
  pre-staged.
* Picks the latest published HF artifact set whose name family matches
  the device implied by ``OVS_PROFILE`` (``nx`` ⇒ ``orin-nx``,
  ``nano`` ⇒ ``orin-nano``).
* Serialized with a module-level lock so concurrent backend preloads
  (ASR + TTS in the same process) do not race on the download.
* Idempotent — if all files are present nothing is downloaded.
* Fail-open: any error during the auto-download is logged and ``False``
  is returned; the caller is expected to re-check existence and raise
  its own ``FileNotFoundError`` if files are still missing.

Why this is opt-out (default-on)
--------------------------------
The legacy ``jetson-zh-en`` profile already auto-downloads Paraformer +
Matcha on first boot. Making the Qwen3 profiles silently fail unless the
user knew to pre-run ``deploy_qwen3_artifacts.py`` was a footgun:
switching to ``jetson-qwen3asr-matcha-nx`` would bring the ASR backend
up with ``FileNotFoundError`` and TTS would respond happily, masking the
problem. Default-on matches the existing first-boot UX. Set
``OVS_AUTO_DOWNLOAD_ARTIFACTS=0`` to opt out for production / air-gap.
