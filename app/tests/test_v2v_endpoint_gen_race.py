"""Regression test for the finalize / speech-start gen-race bug.

Root-cause analysis (codex, 2026-05-19)
======================================

Two trigger paths observed on Orin NX validation, both with the same
discard log line — ``ASRSessionManager: finalize result discarded
(state=ACTIVE)`` — and the same observable symptom: an empty
``asr_final`` emitted for utterance N:

1. **Multi-turn**: VAD ``speech_start`` for utterance N+1 arrives at the
   dispatcher while ``stream.finalize()`` for utterance N is still
   in-flight inside ``asr_out_task``. The dispatcher calls
   ``manager.on_speech_start()``, which preempts the in-flight stream
   (state ACTIVE→CANCELLING→ACTIVE, generation bumped). When
   ``stream.finalize()`` returns, the manager sees state=ACTIVE (the
   *new* utterance is active) and discards the result.

2. **Post-worker-restart**: error recovery creates a new stream and
   issues ``on_speech_start``; the in-flight previous finalize hits the
   same discard path.

Compounding the bug, ``endpoint_pending`` in ``app/main.py`` had no
generation tag. So even after a clean preempt, a stale endpoint stamped
by utterance N could trigger a finalize against utterance N+1's stream,
forcing the manager into a second wrong-generation finalize.

Fix (this commit)
-----------------

``endpoint_pending`` carries a sibling ``endpoint_pending_gen``. The
dispatcher stamps it whenever it sets ``endpoint_pending``; the
``asr_out_task`` consumer gates on it before calling
``finalize_with_generation`` — if the gen doesn't match the current
``asr_active_gen``, the endpoint is dropped on the floor.

Test strategy
-------------

We exercise the *exact* gating block that was added to ``asr_out_task``
by mirroring it in this test, against a real ``ASRSessionManager`` with
a fake backend whose ``finalize()`` takes ~100ms.

Sequence:

1. ``on_speech_start`` for U1 → gen=1, state=ACTIVE.
2. Dispatcher stamps ``endpoint_pending = "vad"``,
   ``endpoint_pending_gen = 1``.
3. Schedule a background task running the slow ``finalize_with_generation``
   for U1 (mimics asr_out_task picking up the endpoint).
4. While that's in flight, ``on_speech_start`` for U2 — preempts U1,
   gen advances to 2.
5. **Critical**: a second VAD speech-end *would have* stamped
   ``endpoint_pending`` against U1's generation in the pre-fix code,
   AND/OR the SPEECH_START path didn't clear the stale endpoint. We
   simulate the pre-fix and post-fix decision and assert the gate fires
   correctly only in the post-fix variant.

The test ALSO exercises a second axis: when SPEECH_START clears the
stale endpoint (fix #2/3 in main.py), the gate is the belt-and-braces
defense if some other path missed clearing it. Both must hold.

Why we do this at the unit level instead of routing real audio through
the FastAPI TestClient: deterministically interleaving the dispatcher
and asr_out_task asyncio tasks at the right point of finalize() is
brittle. The fix lives in two narrow logic blocks; testing those blocks
directly with a real ASRSessionManager underneath is more reliable and
catches the same regression class.
