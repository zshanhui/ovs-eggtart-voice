# OpenVoiceStream — Per-Device Perf Test Runbook

A single source of truth for **how to launch the service on each device**
and **what to measure**, so you can fill in the performance table without
re-tracing setup.

Branch: `qwen3tts-accurate-20260507` (latest commit ≥ `f3ab241`).

## Image registry

| Device class | Image | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Jetson Orin (Nano/NX/AGX) | `sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.12-highperf` | 3.14 GB class |
| RK3576 / RK3588 | `sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:rk-v1.4-closedloop` | 767 MB |

History — Jetson image patches (each fix forced a rebake):
- v1.0 → first slim bake (CMD `sleep 9999` bug, no TRT libs)
- v1.1 → tensorrt + cuda-python + EdgeLLM workers added
- v1.2 → CMD fixed + NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all
- v1.3 → TRT runtime libs added but 1.14 GB layer rejected by registry (413)
- v1.4 → layered TRT/CUDA libs (all < 500 MB), passes registry
- v1.5 → EdgeLLM plugin replaced with W8A16-capable build
- v1.6 → engine_resolver + profile fixes added (missed full app/ refresh)
- v1.7 → full app/ + configs/ refresh, baked OVS_PROFILE blanked
- v1.8 → hf_artifacts User-Agent fix (hf-mirror 403)
- v1.9 → engine_resolver manifest key alignment (model-relative vs full path)
- v1.10 → multilang preset also pulls matcha-icefall-zh-en bundle from Seeed CDN
- v1.11 → model_downloader marker-file freshness check (catches stale dir created by engine_resolver)
- v1.12-highperf → Qwen3 TensorRT-EdgeLLM high-performance artifacts and runtime sidecars aligned with the current release gate
Use v1.12-highperf going forward.

All three are self-contained for their device family. Jetson and RK images are
`docker save` or registry push when distributing to new boards.

## Containers left running for perf tests

After today's sweep:

| Device | Container | Image | Port | Preset | /health |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| orin-nano | `seeed-local-voice` | jetson-v1.12-highperf | 8621 (host net) | jetson-multilang-highperf | ✅ both ready in latest product gate |
| radxa | `seeed-local-voice` | rk-v1.4-closedloop | 8621 (host net) | rk3588-default / multilang | ✅ both ready in latest product gate |

`docker ps` on each device confirms current state.

## Launch commands (per device)

### Jetson Orin Nano / NX / AGX

Requires:
- `--runtime nvidia` + `NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=all` (bundled in image env)
- TRT engines + Qwen3 artifacts on host (for voice_clone / multilang)
- `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` if device has no public WAN

**voice_clone (default — best quality, voice cloning)**
```bash
docker run -d --name seeed-jetson --runtime nvidia --network host \
  -v /tmp/nano-audit:/opt/models/qwen3-edgellm:ro \
  -e OVS_PRESET=voice_clone \
  -e HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com \
  -e QWEN3_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/opt/models/qwen3-edgellm \
  sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.12-highperf
```

**multilang (Qwen3 ASR + Matcha TTS — supports multi-stream)**
```bash
docker run -d --name seeed-jetson-ml --runtime nvidia --network host \
  -v /tmp/nano-audit:/opt/models/qwen3-edgellm:ro \
  -v seeed-models:/opt/models \
  -e OVS_PRESET=multilang \
  -e HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com \
  -e QWEN3_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/opt/models/qwen3-edgellm \
  sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.12-highperf
```

Engine resolver downloads Paraformer/Matcha TensorRT bundles from
[`harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-artifacts`](https://huggingface.co/harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-artifacts)
on first start. Bundles are keyed by host signature, e.g.
`sm87-trt10.3-jp6.2-cuda12.6.tar.gz`; the published manifest can also carry
the graph-surgery ONNX inputs needed for cold rebuilds.

Artifact decision flow:

1. If the local engine sidecar matches the current host signature, use it.
2. Else, if the HF manifest has an engine bundle for the current host
   signature, download/extract that bundle and do not download ONNX.
3. Else, download the ONNX inputs declared in the manifest and compile inside
   the Jetson image.

**lite_zh_en (Paraformer + Matcha — high throughput zh+en)**
```bash
docker run -d --name seeed-jetson-lite --runtime nvidia --network host \
  -v seeed-models:/opt/models \
  -e OVS_PRESET=lite_zh_en \
  -e HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com \
  sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.12-highperf
```

First start downloads sherpa Matcha (~120 MB) + Paraformer (~900 MB) ONNX
to volume; engine_resolver compiles or pulls TRT engines.

### RK3576 / RK3588 (radxa)

Requires:
- Host has NPU kernel driver/devices.
- `--privileged` for NPU device access.
- The RK image vendors pinned userspace runtime libraries under
  `/opt/rk-runtime` and symlinks them to `/usr/lib/librknnrt.so` and
  `/opt/asr/lib/librkllmrt.so`.

RK does not use the Jetson `engine_resolver`; it has a separate artifact
manifest for `.rknn` / `.rkllm` files. The generated RK artifacts are published
to [`harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-rk-artifacts`](https://huggingface.co/harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-rk-artifacts)
and consumed through `RK_ARTIFACT_REPO_ID` + `RK_ARTIFACT_SET`. Official
upstream tokenizers / base resources are referenced instead of duplicated when
available. The host BSP still supplies the kernel/NPU driver.

The analogous RK flow should be:

1. Check SoC, vendored RKNN/RKLLM runtime hashes, toolkit version, quant mode,
   fixed-shape/bucket metadata, and artifact hashes.
2. If compatible, download/use the published `.rknn` / `.rkllm` artifacts.
3. If incompatible, build via a dedicated RK builder image or offline x86
   conversion host, then publish a new artifact set. The runtime image only
   includes `rknn-toolkit-lite2`, so it should not be treated as an RKNN
   compiler image.
4. If the runtime check fails, tell the operator to remove overriding host
   mounts, update the device BSP/runtime, or use an artifact set that matches
   the installed runtime. `RK_RUNTIME_STRICT=0` is only for debugging.

ONNX/sherpa model package and run it directly with CPU ONNX Runtime.

**multilang on RK3588 (Qwen3 ASR via NPU + hybrid Matcha TTS)**
```bash
docker run -d --name seeed-rk --privileged --network host \
  -v /dev:/dev \
  -v seeed-rk-asr:/opt/asr/models \
  -v seeed-rk-tts:/opt/tts/models \
  -e OVS_PRESET=multilang \
  -e RK_ARTIFACT_REPO_ID=harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-rk-artifacts \
  -e RK_ARTIFACT_SET=rk3588-multilang-2026-05-17 \
  sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:rk-v1.4-closedloop
```

profile_selector auto-detects rk3588 (or rk3576) via `/proc/cpuinfo` and picks `rk{soc}-multilang.json`.

RK compose files now set the published HF repo and device-specific artifact
set by default, with named volumes at `/opt/asr/models` and `/opt/tts/models`
so first boot can populate artifacts without host-side model preparation. The
validated RK3588 TTS release path uses `TTS_BACKEND=matcha_rknn`,
`MATCHA_USE_ORT=1`, `MATCHA_MODEL_SEQ_LEN=80`, and `VOCOS_FRAMES=256`: Matcha
acoustic runs on ORT and Vocos runs on RKNN/NPU. The full RKNN Matcha path
(`MATCHA_USE_ORT=0`, sequence length 96, frames 256) remains experimental.


CPU-only (sherpa-onnx). No `--runtime nvidia`, no `--privileged`.

```bash
  -e OVS_PRESET=asr_zh_en \
  -v seeed-models:/opt/models \
```


```bash
  -v seeed-models:/opt/models \
```

## Endpoints to measure

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Headers exposed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/health` | GET | Backend readiness | — |
| `/asr/capabilities` | GET | ASR backend info | — |
| `/tts/capabilities` | GET | TTS backend info | — |
| `/asr` | POST multipart `file=@x.wav` | Offline ASR | `X-Inference-Time`, `X-Audio-Duration`, `X-RTF` |
| `/asr/stream` | WebSocket binary PCM int16 in | Streaming ASR | — |
| `/tts` | POST JSON `{"text":"...","speaker_id":0}` | Offline TTS → WAV | `X-Audio-Duration`, `X-Inference-Time`, `X-RTF` |
| `/tts/stream` | POST JSON → PCM stream | Streaming TTS | `Content-Type: audio/pcm`, `Sample-Rate` |
| `/tts/clone/embedding` | POST multipart WAV → JSON embedding | Voice clone extraction | — |
| `/tts/clone` | POST JSON `{"text":"...","speaker_embedding_b64":"..."}` | Voice-cloned TTS | same as /tts |

## Quick perf snapshot per device

For each device, run these 5 calls in order and record the headers:

```bash
# 0. Health & capabilities
curl -s http://HOST:PORT/health | jq
curl -s http://HOST:PORT/asr/capabilities | jq
curl -s http://HOST:PORT/tts/capabilities | jq

# 1. TTS short (1.5 sec)
curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"你好世界","speaker_id":0}' \
  --output /tmp/tts_short.wav \
  -D /tmp/tts_short.hdr
grep -i "^x-" /tmp/tts_short.hdr

# 2. TTS medium (~5 sec)
curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"今天天气真好，我想出去走走。","speaker_id":0}' \
  --output /tmp/tts_med.wav -D /tmp/tts_med.hdr
grep -i "^x-" /tmp/tts_med.hdr

# 3. ASR short — feed back the TTS output
curl -s -F file=@/tmp/tts_short.wav http://HOST:PORT/asr -D /tmp/asr.hdr
grep -i "^x-" /tmp/asr.hdr

# 4. Streaming ASR (websocat — feed 100ms PCM chunks)
# Manual; latency = time from first chunk to first partial JSON.

# 5. TTS streaming TTFB
time curl -s -X POST http://HOST:PORT/tts/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"你好世界，我是 OpenVoiceStream"}' \
  --output /dev/null
```

Numbers to record into the perf table:
- **TTFA** (time to first audio byte) — measure with `time curl --output - .../tts/stream | head -c 1024 > /dev/null`
- **/tts RTF** (X-RTF header) — inference time / audio duration
- **/tts preload time** — from container `docker logs <name>` look for `"Speech service ready"` minus container start
- **/asr e2e latency** (X-Inference-Time) for 1.5s and 5s clips
- **/asr/stream first-partial delay** (manual)
- **Memory** — `docker stats <name> --no-stream`
- **Image size** — `docker images --format "{{.Size}}" seeed-local-voice:...`

## Measured ASR perf (local mode, 2026-05-13)

All numbers from **local-mode smoke** (`bench/perf/run_on_device.sh <node> -- asr --warmup 5 --runs 10`):
client runs on the device, talks to `127.0.0.1:8621`, eliminating Mac↔device network from measurements.
Corpus: 20 FLEURS files (10 zh + 10 en, 3-15s, sha256-locked). CER is character-level for zh, WER is word-level for en; both computed with Chinese-number normalization (cn2an) so "15米" and "十五米" compare equal.

### Latency: Finalize RTF p50 (compute-bound, lower=better)

`fRTF = eos_to_final_ms / audio_dur_ms`. Independent of client-side realtime pacing.

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short/zh (~3s) | **0.084** | 0.220 | 0.397 | **0.000** |
| short/en (~3s) | **0.072** | 0.254 | 0.386 | **0.000** |
| long/zh (~13s)  | 0.063 | **0.030** | 0.538 | **0.000** |
| long/en (~12s)  | 0.064 | 0.063 | 0.666 | **0.000** |

- **Nano/RK3588 long-audio ~0.03-0.06**: both run Qwen3 ASR, encoder is fast for long content because mel batches stack efficiently
- **RK3576 ~0.4-0.7**: smaller NPU + w4a16 (4-bit) quant trade speed for fit; still well under realtime (RTF<1.0)
- **Nano short-after-long was a 4× cold-tactic regression**, fixed by pre-warming TRT shapes 1..6 at boot (see `EDGE_LLM_ASR_PREWARM_MAX`)

### Quality: CER/WER p50 (lower=better)

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short/zh CER | 5.3% | **2.6%** | 5.3% | 10.5% |
| short/en WER | **0.0%** | 10.0% | 13.1% | 35.7% |
| long/zh CER (normalized) | 8.4% | 10.8% | **7.8%** | 14.5% |
| long/en WER | **3.0%** | 5.5% | 5.5% | 23.6% |

- **English short**: Nano wins (0%) — Qwen3 + TRT-EdgeLLM clearly better than RKNN port + sherpa
- **All Qwen3 variants share the same proper-noun limitation** ("Oravec" → "Work" on zh_long_03); fixing requires model-side tuning, not a device problem

### Known shared issues (today, not blocking)

1. **Mixed-script proper nouns**: "Oravec" / "Smith" in Chinese context → all Qwen3 variants mis-hear identically (~5 chars/error)
2. **FLEURS reference uses Arabic numerals** ("15米") while Chinese ASR speaks Chinese ("十五米"); perf tool's `cn2an` normalizer corrects for this — raw CER may show 30-40pp inflation if you bypass normalization

## Measured TTS perf (local mode, 2026-05-13)

|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| short/zh RTF | 0.425 | **0.071** | 0.163 | **0.078** |
| long/zh RTF  | 0.410 | **0.135** | 0.144 | **0.077** |
| short/en RTF | 0.420 | 0.085 | 0.220 | 0.105 |
| short/zh TFD | 4ms | 4ms | 6ms | 2ms |
| long/zh total | 6738ms | 812ms | 1560ms | 941ms |

- **RK3576 ~2× slower than RK3588**: smaller NPU (2 cores @ 2 TOPS vs 6 TOPS on RK3588) + matcha encoder/estimator/decoder on ORT-CPU fallback (only vocos on NPU). Still well under realtime (0.14-0.22 RTF).
- **Nano Qwen3 TTS slowest** (0.4× RTF) because it's a much bigger model targeting voice cloning + multi-language; tradeoff: highest quality (voice clone)

### Resolved bugs (2026-05-13)

- **Radxa rk:matcha_rknn TTS `'tuple'.encode` crash** — adapter `app/backends/rk/tts.py::generate_streaming` now unwraps `(audio, meta)` tuples to PCM bytes. Fixed in commit `1aa7976`.
- **RK3576 TTS `RKNN_ERR_PARAM_INVALID` vocos crash** — `rk3576-multilang.json` profile had `VOCOS_FRAMES=256` but the deployed vocos engine is `vocos-16khz-600.rknn` (expects 600 mel frames). Profile updated to `VOCOS_FRAMES=600`. Required `MATCHA_USE_ORT=1` to route matcha encoder/estimator/decoder through ORT-CPU (reduces RKNN model count on NPU domain 0). With both fixes: RTF 0.14-0.22 on RK3576. Initial misdiagnosis as "NPU IOMMU conflict" was wrong — actual root cause was a shape-mismatch + Matcha component count.

## Measured V2V perf (local mode, 2026-05-13)

EOS → first TTS audio chunk, `--llm-delay=0` (forced EOS):

|---|---:|---:|
| short/zh | 325ms | **5ms** |
| long/zh  | 909ms | **4ms** |
| short/en | 277ms | 3ms |
| long/en  | 810ms | 4ms |


## Measured concurrent (parallel=2, asr+tts simul, 2026-05-13)

| Device | ASR RTF p50 | TTS RTF p50 | ASR wall p50 | TTS wall p50 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Nano | 1.095 | **1.232** ⚠️ | 4298ms | 5323ms |

- Nano TTS RTF > 1 at parallel=2 — GPU saturated. Voice_clone path is compute-bound.

## Suggested perf table (template)

| Device | SoC | Preset | TTS RTF | ASR fRTF p50 (short) | ASR fRTF p50 (long) | CER zh-short | WER en-short | Image |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jetson Orin Nano | sm87 8GB | voice_clone | 0.42 | **0.084** | **0.063** | 5.3% | **0.0%** | 3.14 GB (v1.11/v1.12) |
| Jetson Orin Nano | sm87 8GB | multilang | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | 3.14 GB |
| Jetson Orin NX | sm87 16GB | voice_clone | **0.400** | **0.079** | **0.066** | 5.3% | **0.0%** | 3.14 GB (v1.12 + hot-mount workers)¹ |
| RK3588 (Radxa ROCK 5T) | rk3588 16GB | multilang | **0.071** | 0.220 | **0.030** | **2.6%** | 10.0% | 1.38 GB (rk-v1.2) |
| RK3576 (cat-remote) | rk3576 8GB | multilang | **0.163** | 0.397 | 0.538 | 5.3% | 13.1% | 1.38 GB (rk-v1.2) |

Measured 2026-05-13 (local mode, 5 warmup + 10 runs); see "Measured ASR perf" section above for full breakdown.

¹ **NX v1.12 (2026-05-13)** — RESOLVED. Root cause: the TTS worker binary baked into v1.12 (45.8MB, md5 `c124d0e2…`, built 5月10) doesn't support the stateful Code2Wav pipeline that the NX engine bundle expects. The newer worker binary (60.7MB, md5 `8b7f94…`, built 5月13) lives in `repro-qwen3/TensorRT-Edge-LLM/build` on the NX host and works fine with the same engine set. **Workaround**: run the v1.12 image with host-mount of the newer workers + the env vars `EDGE_LLM_TTS_WORKER_BIN`, `EDGE_LLM_ASR_WORKER_BIN`, `EDGE_LLM_TTS_STATEFUL_CODE2WAV=1`, `EDGE_LLM_TTS_STATEFUL_CODE2WAV_ENGINE_DIR=…/code2wav_stateful` (see `seeed-nx-v112` container's run config). **Proper fix next session**: rebake v1.12 with the newer worker binary so the image is self-contained. NX measurements below are with the workaround.

### Measured NX numbers (2026-05-13)

ASR (warmup 5 + 10 runs): short/zh fRTF 0.079 / CER 5.3%; long/zh fRTF 0.066 / CER 8.4% (normalized); short/en fRTF 0.070 / WER 0%; long/en fRTF 0.068 / WER 3.0%.

TTS (warmup 3 + 10 runs): short/zh RTF 0.400; long/zh RTF 0.389; short/en RTF 0.413.

V2V forced-EOS llm=0 (warmup 3 + 5 runs): short/zh 323ms; long/zh 876ms; short/en 276ms; long/en 823ms.

**Concurrent p=2 asr+tts simul**: ASR RTF 1.11, **TTS RTF 0.42** (vs Nano 1.23 — NX has GPU headroom; 16GB RAM + more SMs make 2-3 simultaneous users viable where Nano saturates).

## Common gotchas

- **HF_ENDPOINT for China users**: set `https://hf-mirror.com` so engine_resolver can pull bundles. Defaults to `https://huggingface.co` (works internationally).
- **Jetson multilang requires the `qwen3-edgellm-jetson` artifact set** at the path the profile expects. The `-v /tmp/nano-audit:/opt/models/qwen3-edgellm:ro` mount is what supplies it on Nano; for AGX/NX you must `hf download harvestsu/qwen3-edgellm-jetson-artifacts --local-dir <path>` first.
- **RK image vendors userspace runtime libs.** Do not bind-mount
  `librknnrt.so` / `librkllmrt.so` unless intentionally testing a different
  runtime. If `RK_RUNTIME_STRICT=1` reports a mismatch, remove the override or
  update the device BSP/runtime/artifact set.
- **Port conflicts**: default deployments use host port 8621. If that port is already occupied, set `OVS_PORT` for `deploy/install.sh` or override the compose command/port mapping consistently.
- **`docker logs <name>` can be noisy** during first start (model download progress bars). Filter with `| grep -E "INFO|WARN|ERROR|backend|Application|ready"`.

## Reload / restart commands

To re-run a container after stopping:
```bash
docker start seeed-nano-v17     # warm restart, all caches preserved
docker stop seeed-nano-v17       # graceful shutdown
docker logs -f seeed-nano-v17    # tail logs
docker exec -it seeed-nano-v17 bash  # shell inside
```

Volumes (`seeed-nano-models`, `seeed-models`, `/tmp/nano-audit`) are
preserved across restarts. Engines cached in the volume reload in
seconds rather than minutes.

## Rollback

Previous images preserved on each host. To rollback:
```bash
# Jetson
docker run -d --runtime nvidia --network host \
  ... \
  sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.5  # was last known-good

# RK
docker run ... seeed-local-voice:rk-v1.0   # works but uses old (rk3576-default) baked profile

```
