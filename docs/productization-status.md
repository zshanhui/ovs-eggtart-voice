# Productization Status

Last updated: 2026-05-17.

This is the release checklist for making OpenVoiceStream reproducible,
high-performance, and usable as a streaming edge voice library.

## Current Release Artifacts

| Target | Image | Artifact source | Release-gate result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jetson Orin Nano/NX/AGX | `sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:jetson-v1.12-highperf` | `harvestsu/qwen3-edgellm-jetson-artifacts` for Qwen3; `harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-artifacts` for Paraformer/Matcha TRT `zh_en` engines | PASS for Matcha TRT TTS to Paraformer TRT ASR round-trip on Orin Nano |
| RK3576/RK3588 | `sensecraft-missionpack.seeed.cn/solution/seeed-local-voice:rk-v1.4-closedloop` | `harvestsu/seeed-local-voice-rk-artifacts` plus `deploy/artifacts/rk_manifest.json` | Runtime and service PASS; hybrid Matcha TTS to ASR closed-loop PASS on RK3588 |

## Reproduction Path

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Artifact download and verification | Done | RK manifest contains SHA-256 and size for generated RKNN/RKLLM files; Qwen3 high-performance flow verifies HF artifacts. |
| Stable API across backends | Done | `/asr/stream`, `/asr`, `/tts`, `/tts/stream`, `/health`, `/capabilities` stay stable across Sherpa, TensorRT-EdgeLLM, and RKNN. |
| Copy-paste client examples | Done | `examples/stream_tts_to_wav.py` covers zero-dependency HTTP TTS streaming; `examples/v2v_tts_only.py` covers `/v2v/stream` TTS token forwarding. |
| Matcha zh/en automatic language handling | Done | Matcha/Sherpa/RK TTS paths normalize `language=auto` to Chinese/English based on text. |
| Agent multi-mode shell | Done | `ovs-agent run` defaults to `MultiModeApp`; chat, interpreter, monologue, and transcribe modes share the same streaming pipeline. |
| Agent prompt tuning UX | Done | Debug dashboard edits the active mode `system_prompt` and `temperature`, with YAML persistence when started from a config file. |
| Agent runtime robustness | Done | Wake/sleep gates drop late ASR events, PTT/VAD `asr_eos` is deduped per turn, silent modes restore IDLE, and shutdown cancels pending sleep timers. |
| Robot product scaffold | Done | `ovs-agent run companion_robot` provides a dedicated App shell for embodied assistants while reusing the same streaming SLV pipeline. |
| Streaming cache hit metrics | Implemented | Agent parses streamed `cache_metrics`; TensorRT Edge LLM companion repo commit `18a955c` emits cache metrics on the final SSE chunk. |
| Local non-hardware test gate | Done | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs shell syntax, compose config, Python compile, language tests, and agent unit tests. |

## Latest Measured Gate

Raw reports live in `bench/product_results/`.

| Target | Report | TTS short zh RTF | ASR short zh error | TTS to ASR |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| Jetson Orin Nano | `manual-closed-loop-20260517` | smoke PASS | provider TRT/TRT | PASS, similarity 1.00 |
| RK3588 | `product_eval_20260517-152334` | 0.161 | 30.8% | PASS, similarity 1.00 |
| [unsupported] 5 | `product_eval_20260517-152334` | 0.172 | 7.7% | PASS, similarity 0.80 |

Jetson zh_en was reverified on 2026-05-17 after the Paraformer TRT fix using
the production compose/image path: Matcha TRT TTS -> Paraformer TRT ASR returned
`你好今天天气真不错` for `你好，今天天气真不错。` with similarity `1.0`.
The older `product_eval_20260517-135525` row remains a Qwen3 high-performance
benchmark snapshot, not the current zh_en closed-loop gate.

## Remaining Release Blockers

1. Full RKNN Matcha/Vocos TTS is experimental for closed-loop V2V. The release
   profile uses the validated hybrid NPU path: Matcha acoustic on ORT and Vocos
   on RKNN/NPU.
2. Hardware tests are not suitable for public CI yet. They should stay as
   large model volumes.

## Next High-Value Work

1. Re-export or repair the full RKNN Matcha/Vocos TTS artifacts so
   `MATCHA_USE_ORT=0`, `MATCHA_MODEL_SEQ_LEN=96`, and
   `MATCHA_MODEL_FRAMES=256` can pass the same closed-loop gate as the hybrid
   release path.
2. Add a hardware release runner that executes `bench/product_eval.py` on the
   device fleet and publishes the JSON/Markdown reports automatically.
3. Promote TensorRT Edge LLM streaming `cache_metrics` support upstream, or keep
   the companion runtime pinned until that patch is released.
