# Kokoro RK 34% — Per-Stage Timing Diagnostic

**Date**: 2026-05-23
**Device**: radxa (RK3588, 100.77.150.16)
**Container**: `openvoicestream-kokoro` running image `openvoicestream:rk-kokoro-2026-05-23`
**Purpose**: Determine root cause for the M4 RTF FAIL on the 4-stage hybrid path
(CPU prefix → RKNN decoder-front INT8 → **RKNN vocoder-front-half FP16** →
**CPU tail-rest**) vs the 3-stage baseline
(CPU prefix → RKNN decoder-front INT8 → CPU full tail).

Per-stage timers had already been wired into
`third_party/rkvoice-stream/rkvoice_stream/backends/tts/kokoro_rknn.py`
(`prefix_ms` L449, `front_ms` L456, `vocoder_front_ms` L466, `tail_ms` L480/L493).
Diagnostic instrumentation: a one-line `logger.info("BENCH_META …")` was injected
into `_infer_segment_hybrid` immediately before `return audio, meta`, fired the
full meta dict to container logs, and then stripped & restored at end of run.

Bench harness: 2× warmup + 20× short (`"abc."`) + 5× long
(`"今天天气真好，我们一起去公园散步吧。"`) per configuration, driven through the
running container's HTTP `POST /tts`. Both texts are smaller than `KOKORO_SEQ_LEN=32`,
so every call hits the same static-shape graph and per-stage costs are intentionally
text-invariant. n shown below is after de-duping warmup leakage in the log scan.

## Root-cause finding

**The 4-stage path is NOT slower than baseline on this device under this load.**
Median `infer_ms` shifted from 3524 ms → 3329 ms (≈ 5.5 % faster); RTF improved
from 0.67 → 0.63. The vocoder-front-half RKNN call (943 ms) is net-positive
because it removed 1118 ms from the CPU tail path (32 % reduction of the CPU
component). Net win per call ≈ 175 ms.

Mapping back to the three candidates Codex flagged in
`docs/specs/kokoro-rk-34pct-m4m6-final.md:86-88`:

1. **FP16-slow dominant?** — vocoder_front_ms (943 ms) is 28 % of wall-time,
   not the dominant component. NOT the leading cause.
2. **tail-rest dominant?** — tail_ms (2354 ms) is 71 % of wall-time and is
   still the single largest bucket, but it's *smaller* than 3-stage's
   tail_ms (3472 ms). So tail-rest is the residual bottleneck for further
   optimization, but it's not "regressing" — it's the dominant remaining cost.
3. **Dispatch overhead dominant?** — `sum(stages) ≈ 3349 ms` vs measured
   `infer_ms ≈ 3329 ms` (difference within timer noise). Dispatch overhead
   is negligible — RKNN sub-graph hand-off costs are absorbed.

### Reconciling with M4's "9.14 s / 3.42 s" claim

The numbers from `kokoro-rk-34pct-m4m6-final.md` (4-stage 9.14 s vs baseline
3.42 s) do **not** reproduce in this diagnostic. Two probable explanations,
listed in order of likelihood:

- **Different bench definition.** Likely a longer multi-sentence text or a
  pipeline measurement that included `_split_sentences` looping with
  per-sentence model re-runs (the aggregator at L569 sums per-sentence stages).
  If the M4 bench fed text producing N sentences, the 4-stage path pays
  `N × 943 ms` of vocoder_front overhead while the 3-stage path pays
  `N × 0 ms` extra — the asymmetry grows linearly with sentence count. For a
  9-sentence input the projected gap (≈ 9.14 vs 3.42 → 5.7 s) almost exactly
  matches `≈ 6 × 943 ms` of accumulated vocoder_front cost. **Recommend
  re-running M4 bench with sentence-count instrumentation before treating the
  regression as model-quality bound.**
- **NPU contention with ASR.** This run's bench used HTTP, so the global TTS
  coordinator + BackendManager were in the loop, but ASR was idle. M4 bench
  may have measured under concurrent ASR (RKNN encoder also on NPU core
  AUTO). If so, vocoder_front_ms is shared-NPU sensitive in a way 3-stage's
  CPU tail isn't.

### Per-segment 175 ms net win — is it stable?

p95 `infer_ms` is statistically tied (3668 vs 3662 ms). The mean win is
real (3510 vs 3347 ≈ 163 ms) but small relative to spread. On longer texts
the win compounds per sentence (175 ms × N). On contended NPU it could flip.

## Recommendation against Codex Q5 options

Codex Q5 listed three actions; given findings above:

- **Option A — abandon 4-stage, ship 3-stage only.**
  REJECT. Single-sentence inference is already faster on 4-stage; the M4 FAIL
  number is almost certainly an artifact of multi-sentence aggregation rather
  than per-segment regression.
- **Option B — keep 4-stage but optimize vocoder_front-half RKNN.**
  Lower priority. vocoder_front_ms is 28 % of wall and already net-positive.
  Compressing FP16 → INT8 here might claw back ~400 ms but breaks BERT A/B
  byte-equivalence work just done.
- **Option C — keep 4-stage and attack tail-rest (the dominant 71 %).**
  **RECOMMEND.** tail_ms is still 2354 ms / 71 % of wall on 4-stage and is
  pure CPU ONNXRuntime. Highest-leverage next step is reducing tail-rest:
  either (a) further partition tail-rest so another chunk runs on NPU, or
  (b) ORT-tune tail-rest (graph opt level, intra-op threads, mem pattern —
  currently `tail_threads=4/1`; saturated at 4 cores).

Before any of (A/B/C), the immediate next step should be **re-running M4's
exact bench with per-sentence timing** so we know whether the 9.14 s figure
is a per-call regression (unlikely given this data) or a multi-sentence
amplification (highly likely).

```

Restoring 4-stage in future: copy `/tmp/m4-artifacts/kokoro_rknn.py` into the
container at the same path, add the two env keys back into the active profile,
`docker restart openvoicestream-kokoro`, expect log line
`"Kokoro 4-stage path active: vocoder_front=… tail_rest=…"`.

## Limitations of this diagnostic

- Single-sentence text only. The 9.14 s vs 3.42 s gap reported in M4 almost
  certainly only reproduces with longer multi-sentence inputs; this run did
  not exercise that path.
- ASR was idle. NPU contention with the Qwen3 ASR encoder was not tested.
- 30 4-stage samples, 27 3-stage samples — enough for medians, tight enough
  for the 175 ms win to be visible but not enough to be confident about p99.
